#3 GitHub - Create new public repo, copy URL of new portfolio
#4 VSC - Ctl+Shift+p to open cmd palette, type and select "git clone", paste/enter URL
#5 Save repo to local machine (I use a cloud synced folder in C), click "Open Repository" and "Dont Save"
#6 VSC - Create new text file in cloned repo and push back to GitHub - Name/enter some text to file, Ctl+s, click source control, enter note of change, click checkmark to commit changes local on computer, at the bottom make sure VSC is signed into GitHub/click wheel to syncronize to GitHub
#7Now you're syncing to GitHub and creating a version control timeline
